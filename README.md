One Stop Insurance Company Customer Policy System

This is a Python program developed by Phil St Croix to manage customer policies for One Stop Insurance Company. 
The system allows the user to enter customer information such as name, address, and phone number, as well as 
the number of cars to be insured and any additional coverage required. The program then calculates the premium 
amount based on the entered data and saves the customer policy to a file for future reference.

Run the following command to execute the program:

Follow the prompts to enter the customer information and select the policy options.

The program will then calculate the premium amount and save the customer policy to a file named OSICPolicy.dat.
